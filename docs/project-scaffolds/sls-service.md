# Project Scaffold: "luke:sls-service" ([source](../../generators/sls-service/index.js))

A [project scaffold](../project-scaffolds.md) that can be used to create or
recreate a basic Serverless service project (C2C Style).

This scaffold includes everything that the [module scaffold](module.md) includes
as well as many additional [partials](../partials.md) for Serverless development.

## Usage Example

```
$ yo luke:sls-service
```

## Included Partials

The following [partials](../partials.md) are included when this
[project scaffold](../project-scaffolds.md) is used/specified:

* .. todo ..
* [luke:readme](../partials/readme.md)

_Note: Additional, unlisted, [partials](../partials.md) may be automatically
included as [partial dependencies](../partials.md#partial-dependency)._
